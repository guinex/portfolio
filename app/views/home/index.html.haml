              %p.summary System predicts whether a new twitter handle will follow certian celebrities. Data consists of 10 celebrities, their 100 recent tweets and ids of all followers, and 100 recent tweets followers. Prediction is done in 2 ways, first is using the logistic regression we check if followers of the celebrities (who fall are in same category) are more likely to follow other celebrities (of that same category) or not. Second is to check whether a new twitter handle share the same interest as the celebrities or not.
              %p Used logistic regression to check whether a new Twitter handle will follow the selected celebrities or not.

                  I had the opportunity of working with saurabh for 2 years at Mirraw. He started as a junior and i had to mentor him throughout his training period. I observed that he is such a quick learner and could easily juggle multiple projects. We could always trust him for coming up with a solution for any rare development feature as well. Trying out new technologies and his craving for learning new things are the two best qualities that stood out and impressed me particularly.

                  Saurabh is hard working and has excellent web development skills. Inspite of being a fresher in the industry he was able to understand our system in a relatively short period of time and completed all his work diligently and on time. He also did a commendable work on javascript API's and UI.
